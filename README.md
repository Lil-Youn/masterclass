## ðŸš€ About Me
Hi, I'm Simon, 34 years old, a chef for 18 years, and have been working as a head chef for over 12 years.

About 9 months ago, I decided to make a change in my life. Recognizing the importance of continuous growth, I delved into coding, eager to expand my skill set.
From that moment on, everything changed drastically. I explored React, Typescript, and built frontend applications. To further enhance my progress, I embraced asking questions and seeking guidance from experienced peers.

Currently, I enjoy using Ruby on Rails for API backends and React/Typescript for the frontend.
I am experienced with Github, using Github CoPilot and Chat GPT alongside traditional resources.
